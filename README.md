# The need for a solution
There is a need to divide complex electrical installations into manageable subassemblies that can be prefabricated: electrical boxes for wall roughing, light fixtures, transformer wiring, overhead and underground conduits, panels, j-boxes etc. <br />
Creating a native component configurator application for on-site team members will help optimize proper off-site assembly and functionality. This tool provides electrical contractors and subcontractors a productivity-boosting ordering system that communicates detailed assembly needs directly to their distribution center.

# Who is using it
1. Electrical Contractors and Subcontractors
